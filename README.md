# AntirrhinumSRNAse
Files related to Antirrhinum SRNAse project

## Project goals:
1. Description of the new S-alleles \ 
    a. New reference for S-locus, compare with previous ones
    b. Phylogeny and origin (+other species) \
    b. Some insights on structure and function: synteny/structural rearrangements visualization \
    
2. Distribution of S-allels in the hybrid zone \
    a. Frequency in the population \
    b. Spacial distribution: no barrier \
    b. Association with phenotype? \
    b. Maybe F-boxes? \

## Steps/To Do:

    a. Phylogeny and origin (+other species
    b. Some insights on structure and function
3. Distribution of S-allels in the hybrid zone
    a. Cline, association with phenotype
