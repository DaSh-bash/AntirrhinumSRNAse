# AntirrhinumSRNAse
Files related to Antirrhinum SRNAse project

## Project goals:
1. Description of the new S-alleles \ 
    a. New reference for S-locus, compare with previous ones
    b. Phylogeny and origin (+other species) \
    b. Some insights on structure and function: synteny/structural rearrangements visualization \
    
2. Distribution of S-allels in the hybrid zone \
    a. Frequency in the population \
    b. Spacial distribution: no barrier \
    b. Association with phenotype? \
    b. Maybe F-boxes? \

## Steps/To Do:
1. Literature review
2. Description of the new S-alleles \
    Ð°. Polishing the reference:
           a. focus on the gap
           b. try to force Geneious
           b. try BLAST (word-size)
           c. place known SRNAses and conservative regions 
           d. (Geneious annotate, use RNAseq data)
    b. Mapping to the reference
            a. Use BWA
            b. Geneious: manual curation
    a. Phylogeny and origin (+other species
    b. Some insights on structure and function
3. Distribution of S-allels in the hybrid zone
    a. Cline, association with phenotype
