# AntirrhinumSRNAse
Files related to Antirrhinum SRNAse project

## Project goals:
- Description of the new S-alleles 
    - New reference for S-locus, compare with previous ones 
    - Phylogeny and origin (+other species) 
    - Some insights on structure and function: synteny/structural rearrangements visualization 
    
- Distribution of S-allels in the hybrid zone 
    - Frequency in the population
    - Spacial distribution: no barrier
    - Association with phenotype?
    - Maybe F-boxes? 

## Steps/To Do:
- Literature review, keep track of papers, think about journal
- Description of the new S-alleles 
    - Polishing the reference: 
        - focus on the gap 
        - try to force Geneious 
        - try BLAST (word-size) 
        - place known SRNAses and conservative regions 
        - (Geneious annotate, use RNAseq data) 
    - Mapping to the reference 
        - Use BWA
        - Geneious: manual curation 
        - Manual or computational phasing
    - Phylogeny and origin (+other species)
    - Some insights on structure and function
